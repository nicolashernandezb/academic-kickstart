* **"Domain selection in Functional data: a Bayesian approach"**

Joint with [**Gabriel Martos**](https://www.utdt.edu/ver_contenido.php?id_contenido=16862&id_item_menu=27721) & [**Miguel de Carvalho**](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics/people?person=562)

<DIV align="justify">
To improve the performance of supervised methodologies, such as classification, a possible approach is feature selection. This procedure can be developed by selecting points in the domain that have more effect in the response variable (binary) or by defining domain intervals for which the classes of functions present more differences. Under this approach we are developing a novel methodolgy to identify which is the optimal domain that better discriminates the classes of functions.

* **"An RKHS model to forecast functional time series."**

Joint with [**Jairo Cugliari**](http://eric.univ-lyon2.fr/~jcugliari/) & [**Julien Jacques**](http://eric.univ-lyon2.fr/~jjacques/)

<DIV align="justify">
We introduce a novel approach to forecast functional time series (FTS), based on the truncated multivariate representation of the time series, obtained by projecting them onto an appropriate RKHS. We propose a modelization scheme to obtain the h steps ahead prediction, from the multivariate RKHS representation of the FTS data set. A bootstrap method for dependent data and
a minimum entropy criterion is then applied to obtain the point forecast and the confidence bands. As an interesting application, we are conducting an analysis of fertility and mortality rate curves of functional time series forecast.
